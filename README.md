# dotfiles

This repository is a collection of configuration files that I use across my 
systems. It is not intended to be easy to use by everyone, but to serve as a 
backup in case of a new OS setup/upgrade. 

Still, I encourage anyone to explore this repository and use these files as a 
reference for your own configuration files.
